A final group project involving an interactive greenhouse GUI complete with sensors.

The GUI is done in Processing. The Arduino microcontroller is used alongside Wiring to grab desired temperature, moisture, brightness, etc from the GUI. The arduino can then control the slider sensor, the light sensor, the temperature/humidty sensor.


=== updated note === 
Sorry for the mess, folks!
This is basically ALL my work on this project - doing work in separate folders to ensure a single component was working before putting it altogether. 

If you'd like to see the final codes used - check out the display/display.pde (GUI) and display-processing/displayArduino/display/display.ino (controlled sensors).
