A final group project involving an interactive greenhouse GUI complete with sensors.

The GUI is done in Processing. The Arduino microcontroller is used alongside Wiring to grab desired temperature, moisture, brightness, etc from the GUI. The arduino can then control the slider sensor, the light sensor, the temperature/humidty sensor.
